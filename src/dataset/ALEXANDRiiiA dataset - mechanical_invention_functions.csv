IFUNCID0,Jet-Engine,"When molecules go from high pressure to low pressure, we can use them to generate thrust. (Update definition upon further reading on Jet Engine History)",C23A3,p.20,null,null
IFUNCID1,Rocket Engine,"Combines fuel with an oxidizer to facilitate combustions at high altitudes where air-breathing jet-engines can't work, since there is no oxygen. If you bring your own oxygen with you, in a tank, we can facilitate combustion in a vacuum. (Update upon more research on the history of rocket engines)",C23A3,p.21,null,null
